        I am a researcher in Food Science and Technology, specializing in computational modeling and soft matter physics to support sustainable food innovation. My work focuses on plant-based meat analogs and the valorization of food by-products, combining physics-based simulations with data-driven methods to understand and design food structures.
        
        I am passionate about interdisciplinary research at the interface of materials science and food technology and welcome collaborations across food physics, modeling, and sustainability. Please feel free to get in touch. ðŸ˜ƒ
