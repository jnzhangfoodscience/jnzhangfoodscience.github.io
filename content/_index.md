      title: 'My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I am a researcher in Food Science and Technology with a strong interest in the use of computational modeling and soft matter physics to address challenges in sustainable food design. My current work focuses on the structure-function relationships of plant-based meat analogs and the valorization of underutilized food by-products.
        
        Methodologically, I combine physics-based simulations (e.g., FEA, CFD) with data-driven techniques to gain mechanistic insights into food material behavior. This integrated approach supports the rational design of novel food structures and the optimization of processes for improved sustainability and functionality.
        
        My broader research vision lies in advancing a materials-science-informed framework for food innovation—one that is rigorous, interdisciplinary, and closely connected to industrial relevance.
        
        I am always open to academic collaborations across food physics, soft matter, computational modeling, and circular bioeconomy. Please feel free to get in touch. 😃
